## Configure Linux-based web and database servers using Ansible playbooks üìö

## Setup üíª

1. Login to your AWS account
2. Create a Ubuntu-based EC2 instance and install Ansible on it
3. Create a key pair for this control machine which 
4. Create 2 more instances, both CentOS with one as a web server and another as a database server
5. Create a key pair for these instances which will help to ```ssh``` into the instance
2. Download both of the key pairs
3. ```ssh``` into the control machine and copy the key pair for target machines from the local device to the control machine

## Configuration Management Tools ‚öí

* Configuration management tools are idempotent
* They save the state of the target machines
* They always check if the target is already in the same state as the new state
* They will compare the state of the configuration 
* They apply configuration changes only if a difference exists
* But scripts rerun the tasks unless some intelligence is applied to it


## Use cases of Ansible

1. Automation - any system automation
2. Change management - prod server changes
3. Provisioning - setup physical/cloud servers
4. Orchestration - large-scale automation framework

#### Note: Here, we will be using Ansible for change management.



## Hands-on part... üëê


Let's begin by looking at the files in the working directory

* The ```client-key.pem``` file is the key used to ssh into the target machines from the control machine
* There is an inventory file which contains a list of all the target machines
* There are 3 playbooks, one for the web server, one for the database server, and one with configuration for both 
* There is a folder which has ```index.html``` file to be deployed on the web server

### Aim

* Deploy the ```index.html``` file on the web server (using the ```web-target.yaml``` file)
* Create a new database and a new user on the database server (using the ```db-target.yaml``` file)

### Ansible playbooks

* A playbook is like a YAML configuration file
* Each playbook contains multiple plays
* Each play contains tasks that will be executed 
* These tasks are executed on the target machine

### Inventory file
```
all:
  hosts:
    web01:
      ansible_host: 172.31.81.92
    web02:
      ansible_host: 172.31.94.211
    db01:
      ansible_host: 172.31.81.236

  children:
    webservers:
      hosts:
        web01:
        web02:
    dbservers:
      hosts:
        db01:
      vars:
        ansible_user: ec2-user
        ansible_ssh_private_key_file: client-key.pem
```

## Commands to execute üî¢
 
 * Login into the control machine which has the key for the target machines
 * Execute the following commands...

   ### 1. 
   

        ansible playbook -i inventory target.yaml

![image](https://github.com/Vedant-MAHAjan/Database-configuration-with-Ansible/assets/88843623/d7a50350-6f7e-48db-a3ee-6eeedb450b0e)

#### Output

* ```httpd``` service is installed and started on the web target machine
* ```maria-db``` service is installed on the database machine


### 2. 

    ansible playbook -i inventory target.yaml

![image](https://github.com/Vedant-MAHAjan/Database-configuration-with-Ansible/assets/88843623/cdaa8bd3-8ef8-47d4-a161-b8bf8bf4aa5f)

#### Output

* ```maria-db``` service is started and enabled on the database machine
  
### 3.

    ansible playbook -i inventory web-target.yaml

  ![image](https://github.com/Vedant-MAHAjan/Database-configuration-with-Ansible/assets/88843623/2decdab9-4b75-4c90-96ab-8ed874b05108)

#### Output

* The ```index.html``` file is pushed to the web target machine
* The output is available on ```IP_address:80``` of the web server

### 4. 

    ansible playbook -i inventory db-target.yaml

#### Output

* A database is created with the name ```accounts```
* A user is created with the name ```my_user```

### Note üìù

Notice the Gathering Facts in each of the output pictures...

* Gathering facts means Ansible is collecting information on the target machines
* This helps it to compare the current state to the desired state
* If state difference exists, Ansible will apply the new changes to the target machines
